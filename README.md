# ACF Focal Point Field

Adds a new field type to ACF allowing users to draw focal points on images. Utilises Responsify.js

-----------------------

### Description

Adds a new field type to ACF allowing users to draw focal points on images. Uses Wenting Zhang's [Responsify.js](https://github.com/wentin/ResponsifyJS/) to create focal points on images using jQuery.

Works similar to a traditional ACF image field, but once an image is selected and a preview is displayed, this plugin allows drawing a box around a focal point in the image and that image can then be displayed in a nice responsified fasion. View the [ResponsifyJs](http://responsifyjs.space/) homepage for a demo.

Image returned as either tag or object to use within themes.

Last tested on ACF v4  & ACF Pro (5.3.3.2) Compatible.
